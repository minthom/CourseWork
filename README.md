# CourseWork
This is a compilation of notable coursework I have completed thus far. I will continue updating it as I continue my academic career.

## CSE 302 Project Descriptions

### Part 1
Involves obtaining data from a csv file and organizing it into an unsorted array data structure using C++.

### Part 2
Utilizes the same dataset as part 1, but organizes it into two different types of data structures. The data structures selected were a binary search tree, and a queue.
